# Geospatial analytics

## Analytics is computational analysis
> Used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of `meaningful patterns` in data. 

> Applying `data patterns` toward effective `decision-making`.

## Analytics is a superset
Covers multiple domains. Often synonymous with `data science`. Some definitions incorporate business intelligence.

## Geospatial analytics
Combines `spatial`, `numeric`, `categorical`, `temporal` data with `tools that operate seamlessly` across these different types to extract `meaningful patterns`. 

## FOSS enables geospatial analytics
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
In languages like R and Python, the standard packages for data science have been extended to geospatial data. APIs are consistent and entering spatial data science has few barriers.

FOSS4G is disrupting the established use of expensive and specialised software in transport modelling, simulations, mapping etc.

# Policymaking

## Role of government
> Government exists to manage the different `types of market failures` and the `equitable redistribution of resources`. 

## Interventions available to governments
```{mermaid}

## Policy designs government intervention
:::: {.columns}

- Process often starts with problem and proceeds in a "cycle". 
- Analytics plays a role at several points in the cycle.

## Policy without evidence = guesswork and opinions

- Need appropriate information

> What you measure is what you can manage.

- Need relevant knowledge

> With no understanding on what could happen, policy devolves into opinions.

## Analysts and policymakers - a work in progress
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="75%"}
- Analysts with little understanding of policy
- Policymakers with little understanding of information that can be derived from data

## Bringing evidence into policymaking
> Analysts must make the first move

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Ask questions. 
- Learn the domain. 
- Test analyses.
- Make analyses accessible. 
- Share and discuss. 
- Repeat.

# A transport story

## Transport policy
![](assets/mot-policy-framework.png)

## Are markets working?
- To figure out if there is a market failure, policymakers need to understand `how the market works`. `Contextual understanding` use extensive `engagement` with different players. 
- But when things are not working, intelligence from qualitative sources can be heavily biased. `Analytics can provide more objective insights`. 

## Maritime supply chain policy context
![](assets/maritime-ops.png)

## NZ maritime connectivity questions
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted several `issues around maritime trade resilience and connectivity` that the market was unable to address.  To understand the extent of disruption, we need to understand the system. 

- `What routes do ships take?`
- `How long does a route take`?
- `Do ships keep doing the same route?`

## Understanding maritime connectivity with AIS
- AIS data is `ship movement tracks` collected from transponders. 
- `Processed data of port visits` is more convenient as we're interested in port connectivity rather than route taken. Used data from [Starboard](https://starboard.nz/) -  maritime intelligence from Xerra. 
- Writing simple algorithms to identify `routes, voyages and ship schedules`. 
- Learning from `connectivity networks`.
