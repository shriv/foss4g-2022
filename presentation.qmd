# What is geospatial analytics?

## Analytics is computational analysis
> Used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. 

> Applying data patterns toward effective decision-making.

## Analytics is a superset
An umbrella term that covers multiple domains: machine learning, statistical models, business intelligence.

## Why am I telling you all this?
Geospatial data enriches with spatial information. But the same data point can also contain other information - various numeric and categorical characteristics, temporal data etc. Having tools that operate seamlessly across all these different types of information allow for deep and useful insights.
