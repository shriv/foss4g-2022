# Geospatial analytics

## Analytics is computational analysis
> Used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of `meaningful patterns` in data. 

> Applying `data patterns` toward effective `decision-making`.

## Analytics is a superset
Covers multiple domains. Often synonymous with `data science`. Some definitions incorporate business intelligence.

## Geospatial data science

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
An exciting and emerging field that dervies insights with spatial resolution using `new and specialised techniques` and `automation`.

## The value of geospatial data science
Geospatial data enriches with spatial information. But the same data point can also contain other information - numeric and categorical characteristics, temporal etc. `Tools that operate seamlessly across these different types of information allow for deep and useful insights`. 

## FOSS4G value is integration
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
In languages like R and Python, the standard packages for data science have been extended to geospatial data. APIs are consistent and entering spatial data science has few barriers.

## FOSS4G in geospatial data science
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
In transport, FOSS4G is disrupting the established use of expensive and specialised software in transport modelling, simulations, mapping etc.

# Policymaking

## Interventions available to governments
```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#fab005', 'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff'}}}%%

## Policy designs state interventions
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Process often starts with problem and proceeds in a "cycle". 
- Data science plays a role at several points in the cycle.

## Policy without evidence = guesswork and opinions

- Need appropriate information

> What you measure is what you can manage.

- Need relevant knowledge

> Without knowing what could happen from research, policy devolves into opinions. 


## Analysts and policymakers - a work in progress
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="75%"}
- Analysts with little understanding of policy
- Policymakers with little understanding of information that can be derived from data

## Bringing evidence into policymaking
> Analysts must make the first move

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Ask questions. 
- Learn the domain. 
- Test analyses.
- Make analyses accessible. 
- Share and discuss. 
- Repeat.

# A transport story

## Transport policy
![](assets/mot-policy-framework.png)

## Are markets working?
- To figure out if there is a market failure, policymakers need to understand how the market works. 
- Contextual understanding use extensive engagement with different players. 
- But when things are not working, intelligence from qualitative sources can be heavily biased. 
- Analytics can play a role.
